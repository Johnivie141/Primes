# Primes
Find Primes
Simple program implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Needs some work with coding conventions.
download Primes.java
compile using javac Primes.java (OR download Primes.class)
java Primes # where # is a number >0

What do I like -> seems to work. seems reasonable fast. Formatting looks okay. Formatting example in google docs looks off. I prefer output to be more justified.

What would I do if I had more time. - Figure out a way to use a smaller array. Find a better algorithm? This seems reasonably fast though within the memory bounds.  can't find 10000 *10000 primes out of memory error. 1000*1000 takes more time to output to screen than to calculate. 

How to Run.
javac Primes.java PrimesTest.java TestRunner.java

To run the unit Tests "java TestRunner" this will check the prime generation for n=1 to 9
To run the program with other numbers "java Primes #" eg "java Primes 1000"
